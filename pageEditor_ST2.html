            <h2 id="nav">Navigation Bar and footer</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p> 
                        I used a range of style tags in CSS to implement the navigation bar. I put it inside the <i>header</i> and <i>nav</i> tag to make the code 
                        readable by dividing the navigation section. I have used an unordered list to make the navigation bar with a unstructured lust <i>ul</i> , 
                        using hyperlinks <i>a</i> to provide navigation to different pages. I designed it to be as user-friendly as possible since the navigation bar 
                        is the most fundamental part of a webpage, providing the users with an easy-to-access the whole website. The colour I have chosen for the
                        navigation bar was also meant to contrast nicely with the text and logo.
                      </p>
                        <br>
                    <p>
                      Like the navigation bar, the footer provides additional links and credits for the students who also worked on this website. 
                      Also, like the nav, I separated the footer into sections to make the code more readable; I started the footer with the footer tag. 
                      Also, I used the div command to divide the editor part from the other page links, such as the home page, volunteer, feedback and so on.
                      My style follows a minimalist design with a grey background, ensuring readability and staying distinct from the webpage's central part. 
                      I made the footer display flex so the links can be shown in the same line, but all the hyperlinks are displayed vertically to create a cleaner 
                      and more organised visual.
                    </p>      
                    <p>
                      <i>display: flex</i> on nav creates a horizontal menu layout, so ensures it is aligned, <i>justify-content: center;</i> 
                      makes the navigation links in the centre, I added <i>padding: 30px 16px;</i> to increase the clickable area making the usability better, 
                      I have chosen the <i>background-colour: #4CAF50</i> in the nav to provide consistency in the pages and making it lean to a healthy related colour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In the footer I also have used <i>display: flex</i> to align the different sections horizontally to make it more structured, <i>justify-content: space-between</i> to make
                      space in the footer section to separate the editor pages to the other pages of the website, <i>background-colour: #707070;</i> to create a visual separation of the main page
                      to the footer.

                      In the footer, I also have used <i>display: flex</i> to align the different sections horizontally to make it more structured, 
                      <i>justify-content: space-between</i> to make space in the footer section to separate the editor pages from the other pages of the website, 
                      <i>background-colour: #707070;</i> to create a visual separation of the main page to the footer.
                    </p>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                      The navigation bar has a responsive design for smaller screens, and the layout adjusts by stacking the links vertically, 
                      which prevents the navigation menu from becoming overwhelming for the users and makes it easier to interact with the links. 
                      The logo is also repositioned on the top and centre to make it visible.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      The footer also has a responsive behaviour for smaller screens; the layout changes; instead of the hyperlink lists being side by 
                      side, it changes to vertically aligned.
                    </p>

                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                  <p>
                    I have used it on all the pages !DOCTYPE html to ensure proper HTML5 rendering. Also, on both pages, I used a head to contain essential 
                    meta tags such as UTF-8 for character encoding and a title to define the page title for the browser and search engines. Also, on both, 
                    I have added link rel="stylesheet" to add external CSS stylesheets separating the content from the design to make the code more organised 
                    and improve the code readability. Also, I put a main tag to organise the page's main content. It improves search engine optimisation. Also, 
                    I have used section tags to divide related content, improving the code readability. I put h1 and a paragraph at the top of the main content 
                    so the user knows what the website is about at first glance. The content cards were done using a div tag to separate each content page so each 
                    has its space in the page and two other div so the cards get divided into two. All the cards are hyperlinks that lead to specific web pages. 
                    I have done that to improve usability since the user can click anywhere on the card, and it will lead to the page they want. Also, I have added 
                    an img tag so the user can have a visual representation of what the page is about, subheadings saying a key point of the webpage and p tag for 
                    a brief explanation.
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                    One of the CSS techniques I have chosen was doing a main container for the page .main-container-home with a max-width: 100% to 
                    fit in many screen sizes and a text-align:center so all the text in the page appears aligned in the centre. Also, I made cards to 
                    display the web site's content pages, making them interactive for the user. For that, I used the class .content-pages that uses 
                    display: flex for the cards to appear one next to the other. Also, I used gap: 20px to space them from each other and a padding-bottom: 20px 
                    to make that space for the cards underneath. To change each card, I have used .content-page that has border-radius: 10px to give a more modern 
                    rounded appearance, box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px #202020 creates a depth that makes the cards pop for the user, and lastly, 
                    transition: transform 0.3s to make a smooth transition when hovering the cards.
                  </p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                      For accessibility on the content page, I have used alt tag in images so screen readers can describe the image, 
                      so people with sight disability can understand what is being shown, also the page is responsive, it means that smaller 
                      screens can navigate in the page with little problems, the images get smaller to fit in the webpage and the side nav re-scale
                      depending on the screen size.
                    </p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                  <p>
                    I used the main tag to contain the website's primary content, making search engines and accessibility tools to identify the central area of 
                    the website. I made a sidebar with the tag aside to act as a secondary navigation bar to help users quickly access different page sections. 
                    I also used div tags to organise the text and images and a section tag to group the related contents of the webpage. Section tags improve 
                    the webpage's structure and accessibility by defining the different topics, using tags like main, section and aside, and improving the screen 
                    reading compatibility, making it more accessible. The alt attribute in images also makes it accessible to visually disabled users.
                 </p> 
                 <br>
                 <p>
                  There are multiple CSS techniques used. One example is position: sticky on the sidebar, which keeps the sidebar visible while scrolling 
                  down the page. Also, in the sidebar, the property top: 60px ensures that the sidebar stays below the header when scrolling the page. This 
                  helps to avoid overlapping the sidebar with the navigation bar, making it better for the user to see the webpage. In the main content, using 
                  margin-left: auto and margin-right: auto helps centre the images dynamically, ensuring they are well-aligned across many different screen sizes.
                 </p>

                      For accessibility on the content page I have used alt tag in images so screen readers can describe the image,

            <h2 id="table">Table Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>
                      In the table page, I used the tags table, tr, th and td; those tags are necessary for creating tables. 
                      The tag table represents that a table is being made, tr defines a table row, th is used for the table header, 
                      and td is for regular data cells that display the table's content (exercise, types, recommendations). There were many CSS used in the 
                      table; one of such is width: 80%, which makes the table not touch the sides of the page, combined with margin: 0 auto, making it go to 
                      the centre of the page, making it better readability for the user since it is contained in the centre of the page. border-collapse: collapse 
                      removes the gap between the cells of the table, box-shadow adds a subtle shadow around the table, making it a floating effect to provide a 
                      more modern aesthetic, adding padding inside th and td make sure that the text in the cells of the table does not touch the borders of the 
                      cell, making the table more legible. I chose to add a green colour to the table's header because the colour is related to health, which is 
                      the website's purpose. To add a hover effect, I have done tr:hover, and in the CSS, I changed the background-colour to a slighter, darker 
                      shade of the colour, making it interactive for other users so they can focus on the row they are looking at.
                    </p> 
                 <br>


                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                      The page can change the layout for many screen sizes using @media in the CSS file. I have used display: block so the table gets 
                      displayed in columns, making it better readable for the users. Also, I have added a border so the user knows where the information ends.

            <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>
                  Thinking about the design for the page was one of the most challenging parts of creating this website. 
                  I have discussed a good design for the webpage with all the other group members. The website prototype had a 
                  completely different colour scheme with a blue navigation bar and a blue side nav. After looking at healthy-focused websites, 
                  I changed the colour to green, making it more related to the website's primary focus.
                </p> 
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Implementing the side navigation on the website was something that I had never done before. I have spent hours trying to figure out and 
                    watching YouTube videos and different websites on how to implement it, and after a while, I have been able to implement it on the website 
                    with the help of Gianluca(Student 1)
                </p> 
                <p>
                  Lastly, in this group work, the group decided to use the git method to collaborate with the website. That was my first time using git, so it was a big challenge. I had to search articles and videos to learn how to use it, but I understood it after the first week of creating the website.

            <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                  Throughout creating this website, I have made sure that on every page, I followed
                   Janet's Compliance; none of my pages harms the network security of any users, 
                   all the pages use ethical and lawful use of the network of users, and no webpage 
                   is using user data or selling user data to third-party companies since no page is 
                   gathering data from users, all pages that I have done it is used semantic HTML 
                   for the document structure like header, nav, section and so on. The pages have 
                   keyboard navigability, making them accessible to more people. Also, I have ensured
                    that all the information and images are copyright-free.
