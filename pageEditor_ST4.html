                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        The User-Profile page is one of the fundamental pages throughout the
                        entire project site, it provides the users a set of navigational
                        links and buttons to communicate and get to know more about their
                        profile. For instance, I have used a "buttons" to incorporate
                        flawless movements between the pages for instance if you would like
                        to contact their is a contact button which instantly take you to the
                        contact page. I have also made it very user-friendly by having hover
                        effects so that all the different types of users dont have any
                        problems, this includes users also that are blind and have problems
                        in navigating through pages. In some aspects I have also used tag
                        elements such as "strong" tags so that it can make our site much
                        more bolder and put more emphasis on the most important things.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>In addittion, I have used a range of style tags in css to implement the different sections such
                        as
                        the main sections and make sub sections within these sections. This was done to ensure that each
                        part of the page is not confused when applying the css and all sections are unqiue in their own
                        ways. I have designed my main container sections in this way to ensure easy accessibility when
                        reading the code and also easy to navigate for the end-users. I have also the used the "li"
                        properties to show a flow rather than having paragraphs all of the time in the entire website
                        and showcased my skills through the use of bullet points. I have also used a variety of div tags
                        for
                        putting my images within a container so that i can apply the correct css so that i can merge one
                        or
                        more images and video in a good position. I have also created a skills section and showcased
                        that
                        through the skills bar instead of speaking about it to see and what level my skills are which is
                        a
                        more visual interpretation. I have also used table tags to create a tab to showcase my
                        availability
                        and bookings of meetings which I have had with a client. </p><br>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>

                    <p>To address accessibility in this webpage, several measures were implemented to ensure an
                        inclusive
                        user experience. Semantic HTML elements such as "nav", "header", "section", and "footer" were
                        used
                        to provide better structure and readability for screen readers. The navigation menu includes
                        descriptive anchor texts, and the "img tags" elements have meaningful alt attributes to assist
                        visually impaired users. Proper color contrast was maintained using CSS variables to enhance
                        readability. Additionally, buttons and links are clearly distinguishable with hover effects and
                        focus states, improving keyboard navigation. The form fields include placeholder attributes and
                        the
                        required attribute to assist users in completing the form correctly. Moreover, a responsive
                        design
                        was applied using CSS grid and flexbox, ensuring usability across different devices and screen
                        sizes. These accessibility improvements enhance the overall user experience, making the site
                        more
                        inclusive for all users.</p><br>

                    <p>In addittion, to address the accesibility of the entire of the page I have made it fully
                        responsive
                        for both mobile and desktop responisveness. I have also made sure that the font-size for all of
                        the
                        things are a decent size so there is not any issues with any of the end users that will be
                        browsing
                        through my site. I also made sure to use the hover effects and use a sustainable color pattern
                        aswell, not too dark and not too light to ensure visibility for all users is at ease. Also, I
                        have
                        also used the feature of sections so that the users can click on sections and it will take you
                        there
                        and have ensured to make all my buttons responsive so that if anybody wants to contact us for
                        instance they can click on the contact us button which will take them to a form so that they can
                        submit their request which will then send us an email with their enquiry. </p><br>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="sitemap">Sitemap Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>

                    <p>The sitemap is built using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) elements, this structure allowes for a
                        visually interactive representation of the different sections of website and pages to be
                        connected
                        in a way to show where which connection has been done in a more visual way throughuot the entire
                        website solution. There are a couple of tags that have lots of importance; one of these are the
                        SVG
                        tags, they play an important roll in definning the overall drawing where all of the nodes, lines
                        and
                        the text are placed. It uses the Viewbox="0 0 1000 600" attribute, which is a coordinate system
                        wheere (0,0) is the top left corner and (1000,600) is the bottom right. This allows for a
                        scalable
                        vector graphics that can adjust to different screen sizes without loosing its clarity.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>Importance of the SVG in the sitemap :</strong> The SVG element is a crucial bevause it
                        enables precise positioning of each sitemap node and connection. Unlike the traditional HTML
                        element
                        like div, SVG allows elements to be placed based on a coordinate system rather than relying on
                        CSS
                        Layouts. This ensures that the node and lines maintain a consistent structure regardless of the
                        viewport size. It alos provides better scalability and interactivity as nodes and line can be
                        dynamically updated or animated using CSS and Javascript however in this soution I have not used
                        Javascript only a bit of CSS has been implemented.</p><br>

                    <strong>Lines, Nodes, and Text: Building the Sitemap Structure:</strong><br>
                    <p>The "line tag" elements play a crucial role in visually connecting different sections of the
                        sitemap,
                        forming a clear hierarchical structure. Each "line tag" is positioned using x1, y1 (starting
                        point) and x2, y2 (ending point), effectively linking parent and child pages. These lines ensure
                        that users can easily follow the structure of the website, understanding how pages are grouped
                        and related. Without these connections, the sitemap would appear as disjointed elements, making
                        it harder to interpret the site’s layout. Additionally, their styling (stroke: black;
                        stroke-width: 2;) ensures they are clearly visible while maintaining a professional and
                        organized look. The sitemap mimics real-world navigation by guiding the user’s eye from primary
                        to secondary pages, improving usability and site comprehension. <br><br>

                        The "rect tag" elements serve as clickable nodes, visually representing each page in the
                        sitemap. By defining their x and y positions within the "svg tag", they are strategically
                        placed to maintain an intuitive structure. The rounded corners (rx="20") create a more
                        polished and user-friendly design, differentiating the nodes from rigid, square
                        elements. These nodes are styled with fill: #6A0DAD to maintain visual consistency, and
                        the hover effect (fill: #9C27B0) provides feedback when interacted with, improving the
                        user experience. Since they are wrapped inside "a" tags, the "rect tag" elements also
                        function as navigation buttons, allowing users to seamlessly move between pages.
                        This transforms the sitemap from a static reference tool into an interactive
                        navigation aid, making it highly functional.<br><br>

                        Each node is labeled with a "text tag" element, ensuring that users can easily
                        recognize the purpose of each section. Positioned using text-anchor="middle"
                        and dominant-baseline="middle", the text remains perfectly centered within
                        its corresponding rectangle. The styling (font-size: 14px; font-weight:
                        bold; fill: white;) ensures maximum readability, making the labels stand out
                        against the dark background of the nodes. Without these text elements, users
                        would have to guess the purpose of each node, reducing the effectiveness of
                        the sitemap. The "text" tag plays a vital role in clarity and
                        accessibility, ensuring that the sitemap remains easy to read and
                        navigate, even for users unfamiliar with the website structure.</p><br>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>In this page the accessibility has been put in measure by making sure that a tags have been
                        assigned
                        so that users can click on the relevant pages they would like to go to on the users end and also
                        ensure a hover effect on all of the nodes have been put so that all sorts of users can have an
                        easy
                        to use and navigation, which is ease for all users no matter what age they are. This sitemap
                        page
                        has been designed with accessibility in mind by incorporating screen reader support, clear
                        visual
                        hierarchy, and interactive elements. The use of "a" tags around the nodes ensures that screen
                        readers can recognize them as navigational links, allowing users with visual impairments to
                        access
                        different pages. The addition of aria-label attributes provides clear descriptions of each
                        link’s
                        destination, improving usability for assistive technology users. The high-contrast color scheme,
                        with dark purple nodes and white text, enhances readability, making the sitemap easier to
                        interpret
                        for users with low vision. Additionally, the large, well-spaced nodes and connecting lines
                        create a
                        structured layout, ensuring users can visually follow the site's hierarchy without confusion.
                        These
                        considerations make the sitemap both functional and accessible, providing an intuitive
                        navigation
                        experience for all users.</p><br>

                        The content page I designed is one of the most important pages in my project, focusing on the
                        Importance of Good Health and Wellbeing, a topic I chose from the 13 UN Goals that I support. To
                        build this page, I carefully used a variety of HTML and CSS elements to ensure both
                        functionality
                        and professional design. Some of the key tags I implemented include section tags, div tags, list
                        elements, video and iframe elements for embedding media, containers, and the use of classes and
                        IDs
                        to structure and style the content effectively. <br><br>

                        I used external CSS to keep the styling separate from the HTML document, making the code more
                        organized and easier to maintain. The IDs were particularly useful for classifying different
                        sections and enabling smooth navigation within the page. One of the standout features I
                        incorporated
                        is a side navigational panel, which is fully responsive and allows users to jump to different
                        sections effortlessly. Additionally, I used containers to position multiple images side by side
                        in a
                        landscape format, ensuring a cleaner and more professional look rather than stacking them
                        vertically, which could appear cluttered and less visually appealing. <br><br>

                        The webpage was structured using key HTML elements such as
                        "section", "div", "nav", lists, and media elements to create an organized and visually appealing
                        design. The "section" tags were used to divide the page into meaningful sections, improving
                        readability and making it easier to apply specific styles to different parts of the
                        content. "div" elements were used as containers to group related content together,
                        ensuring proper alignment and layout control. This was especially important for
                        positioning images and text in a structured manner. Additionally, unordered "ul"
                        and ordered "ol" lists were incorporated to present key points clearly, making
                        the content more digestible for users.

                        For multimedia integration, "video tags" and "iframe tag" elements were used to embed
                        videos, enhancing user engagement by providing visual content
                        directly on the page. <br><br> Containers were implemented to neatly arrange
                        multiple images, preventing them from stacking awkwardly and instead
                        displaying them in a landscape orientation for a professional look.
                        Classes and IDs played a crucial role in styling and functionality;
                        classes allowed for consistent styling across multiple elements
                        using external CSS, while IDs were used for targeted styling and
                        smooth navigation. The side navigation panel, built with the "nav tag"
                        element and linked to section IDs, made the page more
                        interactive by enabling quick access to different sections.
                        Overall, these elements contributed to a well-structured,
                        visually cohesive, and user-friendly webpage.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        Accessibility was a key consideration in designing this page to ensure that all users, including
                        those with disabilities, could navigate and interact with the content effectively. One of the
                        main
                        accessibility features implemented was semantic HTML, which helps screen readers and assistive
                        technologies understand the structure of the page. The use of "section", "nav", and "div"
                        elements
                        ensured that content was organized logically, making it easier for assistive technologies to
                        interpret.
                        The navigation panel was designed to be keyboard-friendly, allowing users to navigate through
                        sections
                        using the tab key and ensuring proper focus states for interactive elements.

                        In addition, I made sure that my content page was accessible by adding hover effects and making
                        it
                        fully responsive with a reasonable sizing for all type of reader to access the content with a
                        variety of images so that user does not get bored.

                <section>
                    <h2 id="challenge">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p> The most challenging things througout this was designing the
                        different sections on the User Profile pages and also having multiple meetings and
                        making sure all
                        the color scheme has been balanced throughout the entire pages and all the different
                        sections.
                        Therefore in order to maintain the flow in the website what I did is made rough
                        color scheme designs
                        and then followed so that it flows with the rest of the website and shows a
                        continuity on the entire
                        site. At times I also struggled to code particualar pages therefore I used couple of
                        youtube videos
                        and w3schools.com to ensure which part i was stuck and making sure that the styling
                        of the CSS and
                        page in general was up to the standards of the team. Also, the implementations of
                        the container box
                        and using div with different sections and classes was my first time so it took a bit
                        of time to get
                        the grip of how the code was actually working but after practicing and reading a
                        couple of articles
                        i understood the method quite well and now it seems self explanantory. <br> <br>
                        Another difficulty
                        was making
                        the sitemap and making sure that this specific page represnted all of the other
                        pages layout and was
                        functional so the users can move to other pages as and when they want to navigate
                        from one page to
                        another and most importantly making it both phone and laptop responsive. I managed
                        to do this
                        effectively by discussing with my team as to what tags are the most important to do
                        this and was
                        then able to effectively completed this section and make it responsive to meet the
                        clients. The
                        lessons that I learned from this is that software development is a ongoing learning
                        process and
                        you'll always be learning something new and you need to be extremely creative and
                        can not think
                        about giving up any cost and pursue excellence in this type of industry. Also,
                        another thing i
                        learned from overcoming these challenges is that if you accept the challenge of
                        having to completed
                        this no matter what comes in your way you know you have to complete it and meet the
                        requirements and
                        make sure it is good looking and that nothing is impossible when it comes to coding
                        they are so many
                        support resources aswell to help you fix the bugs and issues.</p>
