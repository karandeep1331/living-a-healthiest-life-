            <h1>Karandeep Singh Jalf - Editor's Page</h1>
            <section>
                <h2 id="feedbackpage">Feedback Page</h2> <!--subheading -->
                <p>The feedback form provides a set of questions for the customers to answers, the form is about the users health well-being
                     and how it can more better also the feedback form also gives us an idea how we can improve the website for users, 
                     so it can be more easier for the users next time the user goes on the website.</p> <!--paragraph 1 -->
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p> Throughout out the feedback page that has been created I used arrange of HTML and CSS coding to build the page I used
                        different types of "div class" this is so that i can control that part of code on the webpage. With this class I can 
                        control the CSS where I can make the text or the border different sizes or different colours. In a feedback page it
                        was important that I made the fields that were created have an error message shown to the user if the field is empty 
                        this is so that the user doesn't forget and presses the submit button. The way I did this was I used the code of 
                        "required" at the end of the sentence of written code and when the user runs the feedback page the page wont let 
                        the user submit until the field has been filled with the correct information. Which goes to my next point, On the 
                        feedback form there a field called phone number. If the user doesn't write a UK standard 11 digit number it will 
                        give an error message showing that it doesn't match the request format, which means that its not valid number.
                        With the use of email address if the user doesn't put an "@" symbol in the field the error message that will be 
                        shown that the field is missing the symbol.</p>
                    
                    <p> When I started making the feedback form, I had to use a code of form action="#popup" method="get">, this code makes in 
                        an standard of an feedback form. the form action of popup, is when the user presses the submit button, a popup message 
                        will display to the user showing that the form has been successfully submitted. I then closed the form and the end just 
                        before the footer starts. </p> <!--paragraph 2 -->
                        
                        <p>When it comes to CSS, the CSS sheet that I linked to my feedback form HTML helped me to format and change the look and design 
                            of the feedback form. With the use of the CSS that I have written at the top, I was able to create my text field and the form
                            format. As with the form code this was the main design of the form, which made the feedback form in the middle and in the style 
                            that the feedback form is in now. I then used the format of feedback, which you might have seen I used for the personal
                            information as a class, which has been used to design and edit the fields, this been used for sizing and colour, width, 
                            height and padding. </p> <!--paragraph 3 -->

                        <p>With using the class submit, I was able to control the submit button, where I could with the use display: block; it ensures 
                            that button takes up the full width with margin: 0 auto; the button can be centered in its container. The text-align: center; 
                            helps align the word “submit feedback.” I then controlled the button with a hover, where when the user hover over the button 
                            the user will see a grey colour. I customised the button itself which will appear on the page, were I used colour of blue, 
                            and white colour for the word written. I used margin and border to align the button. I then I created a reset button, were I used 
                            the div class of reset which allowed me to use the same format of submit but I changed the colour to red. I also then made the
                             reset button and hover for the user too.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p> On the feedback page I have used different types of accessibility which includes keyboard navigation this is where users
                            can navigate on the form using the keyboard only were the user can use the (tab) button. The second accessibility that
                            I have used is that when the user goes on the feedback page the fields are all styled red, which helps the user to show
                            that the fields needs to be filled, when the user and written something in the field the red style around the field will
                            disappear. As well as on the feedback page I have added an go up button which allows the user to press when the user is
                            at the bottom of the page, and the button will allocate the user to the top of the page. At the bottom of the form next 
                            to the submit button I have created a reset button, the button allows the user to press which deletes all the fields 
                            that are filled, so that the user doesn't need to delete each one manually. </p>

                <h2 id="team">Team Page</h2> <!--team page-->
                        <p>On the team page, where the user can learn about the team who created the website and the user can also
                        find out which team member did which page in the website. And were you can learn more about the team,
                        which includes the name and the roles that were assigned.
                            </p>  <!--paragraph 1 -->
                    
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3> <!--technical description-->
                    <p>On the team page that I have created I have used HTML and CSS to build the page. Throughout the code I 
                        have used arrange of Div class, this so that I can change the style of the written text or box that is
                        displayed on the page, As shown on the team page there is a box container which reveals about each team 
                        member when the user hover over it. I also made an DIV class for the details of the team member, were I 
                        can control the details size, colour and text aligning. On the webpage I have written that the user would 
                        need to hover over the image to learn more this is because user's may think that its only pictures on the
                        team page not any information, when the information is hidden in a container. When the user hover each 
                        image the user will find out the editor name and the role that was carried out in the website.</p>
                         
                        <p>the main CSS that I have used to create the team page on the website. The .team-container class uses 
                        display: flex; to align the team members in a row while center them with justify-content: center;. 
                        It also includes gap: 20px; to create spacing between members and margin: 110px auto; to ensure proper 
                        positioning on the page. Each team member is styled with the .team-member class, which gives them a white
                         background, rounded corners (border-radius: 10px;), and smooth hover effects using transition: transform 0.3s,
                          opacity 0.3s;. When hovered over, the .team-member scales slightly (transform: scale(1.05);) and 
                          reduces opacity (opacity: 0.8;) for a subtle interactive effect. The profile image is contained within
                           .container, which ensures the image is rounded with border-radius: 100px; and fits properly using 
                           object-fit: cover;. Additionally, the .details class is initially hidden (display: none;), 
                           but when a user hovers over a team member, the details become visible (display: block;), 
                           creating an interactive and engaging experience.</p> <!--paragraph 2 -->

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3> <!--Accessibility -->
                    <p>On the team page I have created the webpage so that it can help users with accessibility, the first 
                    accessibility that I have added is alt text, this is so that the users have enhance accessibility 
                    for screen readers. Alt text is brief text description what the image is about. The second accessibility 
                    that I have added in the webpage is keyboard navigation, this is so that the users can make interactive
                    thumbnail accessible via the keyboard.</p>  <!--paragraph 3 -->

                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2> <!--content page-->   
                <p>On the content page is all about dealing with stress, and different techniques user's can use and help them
                     deal with stress, I have written different types of techniques which help and may come helpful for the user 
                     who may read the page about dealing with stress in there day to day life.</p>

                   <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>On the content page you will find different types of techniques how to manage stress for a balanced well-being.
                     In the content page I gave an introduction of stress management, meditation benefits, yoga benefits, how emotions
                      affect the immune system, dealing with anxiety and finally impact of social media with balanced well-being. 
                      in the html code I also added images and video. To insert an image on the page I used the code of img 
                      src="assets/content3/immunesystem.jpg">, the word asset is the folder where all the images are placed, content3 
                      is the folder were the pictures for the page has been saved, and immune system is the name of the picture. 
                      With this code I can insert an image on the image. For the video I used video controls src="assets/content3/meditation.mp4" 
                      which also means the same concept but I changed the image name to the video name to insert the image onto the content page. 
                      On the left hand side of the page there is an sidebar, this sidebar I so that the users can navigate to the content that 
                      the user would like to see. However if the user would like to go down by scrolling the sidebar will also go down as well.
                       Which helps the user with accessibility. </p>

                    <p> With the use of CSS, I managed to center and align the images that I have been using for my content page which was about dealing 
                        with stress, on the content page I didn't use much CSS as much I did for my other pages that I have created. Its only been used for
                         the images, and text to be in the center. I have also used it for the (go top) button which allows the user to press and goes to the
                          top of the page. </p>
                    <!--paragraph 1 -->
                    
 
              
                        <p>On the content page I have used arrange of html and css code, to build the content page about well-being. On the page 
                            I have used arrange of images to show examples on how to maintain your stress on well-being. I have used a sidebar 
                            which can navigate the user to certain subheadings that have been added. The sidebar is located on the left side 
                            on the page.</p> <!--paragraph 2 -->
                     
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>On the content page I have used accessibility, which can help the user's navigate around the website. As shown the 
                            content page there is a sidebar on the left hand side, this sidebar helps the user who visiting the page to click
                             on the part, which the user is interested in. When the user clicks on the button from the sidebar it will navigate 
                             to the part, where the user can read about keeping a well-being. On the bottom right hand corner, there is a go up 
                             button which allows the user to press and it goes to the top of the page instead of the user scrolling up. As well 
                             as for the images that I have used I used alt text which allows the user to know what image is about.</p> <!--paragraph 3 -->

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2> <!--challenges and lessons learned-->
                    <p>During the process of making the feedback page there was challenges and lessons that were learned.
                         Such as I had to make all the fields that I created all required to fill, which means that the user 
                         wont be able to press the submit button without filling out the required fields. 
                         This was challenging to create, but however after doing research and looking at lectures I
                          figured out how to make the fields required, so that an error message appears if the field 
                          is incorrect format, or invalid. I have now learned how to make the field have an error message 
                          appear for the users if the submit button is pressed. </p> 

                    <p>The second challenge that I had during the process was styling error with using CSS, this is for when the 
                        fields on the feedback form is left empty, but should be filled. It was challenging to create red colour 
                        border on the field box for the user to know that the fields needs to be filled. However I did research 
                        and asked my team for support and I managed to make a styling colour border for the feedback form. </p>

                    <p>Creating the rating system for the feedback form was challenge to create. This I had to make the stars that are 
                        created interactive and hover effects, so that when the user clicks on the stars all the stars appear if its
                         more than one star. With the use of CSS and research on the websites, I manage to use CSS to make hover 
                         effects and make the rating system interactive for the users to click on. I also made the colour of the
                          stars to gold. </p>

                    <p>Making the team page there was few challenges that were occurring when creating the page, as the requirements 
                        that were given to me, was to make the information about the user hidden, were the user has to hover over the
                         container, to see the information about the student and the role that the student did during the website.
                          With the use of the container that I created, I managed to make the text in the box so that it's not 
                          visible on the page. I did have some challenges making that, but I used websites and video to help me 
                          create the container, and then I implemented more additional code, so that it meets the requirements.</p>

                    <p>on the content page there were few challenges that I was facing when I was creating the page. 
                        The first issue was that I had to think of a topic within healthy life and well-being which is our
                         topic that we choice to make the website. Then after this I had issues with the images, on the page. As 
                        the pictures wasn't the same sizes the images was making the web page more bigger. But however I managed to
                    sort the problem out.</p>

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2> <!--compliance-->
                    <p>throughout the website I have kept in mind of the compliance in order creating my pages on the website,
                        such as I have used accessibility which has been used for the feedback page, team page, content page.
                        As for the team page and content page I have used alt text for the images that I have implemented. 
                        This is so, the user who is viewing the website can see the alt of the image that is displayed and can
                        know what the image is about. Within the feedback form, it ask for personal information from the user,
                        however this information does not stay within the system, and doesn’t save inside the website. 
                        This means that the information that the user enters is perfectly safe, as it doesn't save anywhere. 
                        Along with this the website is completely safe to use, as the user can see from in the URL, that it 
                        starts with HTTPS which means its a safe website to view on.</p>
